/***************************************************
Areas of Circles and Triangles

Write a program that calculates areas of circles
and triangles, where the use chooses which kind of
object he wants to caclulate areas for.

The area of a circle is Pi r^2, where r is the
radius and Pi is approximately 3.14159265358979324.
The area of a triangle is 1/2 b h, where b is the
length of the base, and h is the height.

  // can be used afterwards
