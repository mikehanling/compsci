/***************************************************
Grading

A school tracks grades as A, B, C, D or E (not F).
A students GPA is a number between 0 and 4, which
you calculate by averaging the grades - an A is
given 4 points, down to an E which is given 0 points.

Write a program that reads in 4 letter grades (a 
student's first semester) and prints out his GPA.
