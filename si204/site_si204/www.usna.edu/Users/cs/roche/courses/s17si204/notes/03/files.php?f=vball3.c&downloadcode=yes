/*****************************************************************
 Volleyball version 3

 This is the "old rules" of volleyball prior to the adoption of
 the current rally system.

 Every rally has a serving team (initially team 1), and the
 serving team is the only one that can score. So if the serving
 team wins the rally, they get one point, but if the other team
 wins the rally, the don't get any points. However, whoever
 wins each rally gets to serve the next rally.

 Because games are lower-scoring, you only play to 15 points.
 However, you still have to win by 2 points. So the winner is
 the first team to have at least 15 points and at least 2 points
 more than their opponent.
