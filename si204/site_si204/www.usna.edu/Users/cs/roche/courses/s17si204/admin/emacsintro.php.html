<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Launching Emacs</b>
    Launch emacs like this: <code>emacs&amp;</code>.  That's
    a linux thing, not an emacs thing.  This way, emacs
    launches but the terminal comes back for more commands
    instead of waiting for emacs to finish.
    If you want to edit or create a file at the same time
    you're launching emacs, put the file name in before the
    &amp; sign.  For example: <code>emacs foo.cpp&amp;</code>.
  </li>
  <li><b>Don't Panic!</b> If things get strange in emacs, hit ctrl-g.  If that
    doesn't clear up, try ctrl-].</li>
  <li>
    <b>Insert vs. Overwrite</b>
    Emacs works in either "insert" or "overwrite" mode just
    like most text editors and word processors.  The
    "insert" key on your keyboard toggles between them.  On
    the bottom of the window you'll see "Ovwrt" when you're
    in overwrite mode.  Play with that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Moving Around</b>
    Pressing ctrl and using the left or right arrows
    jumps you word-by word through a line.  Pressing ctrl
    with the up or down arrows jumps you to chunks of text
    separated by blank lines.
    ctrl-a jumps you to the start of the line you're on, and
    ctrl-e jumps you to the end.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Cutting and Pasting</b>
    The GUI's cut and paste works with emacs, but emacs
    also has its own, separate system.  ctrl-space sets a
    start point, move with arrows to the end point of the
    region you want to mark (it should highlight).
    Then ctrl-w cuts the highlighted region into
    the emacs version of the clipboard,
    and ctrl y "yanks" it out at whatever point you
    move the cursor to.  If you want to copy the highlighted
    region to the emacs version of the clipboard without
    cutting it out of the text, that's esc-w.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>My Favorite &mdash; ctrl-k</b>
    An alternative to marking a region is to use ctrl-k,
    which kills the line from the point of your cursor to
    the end of the line, adding it to the emacs version of
    the clipboard.  You can
    do this multiple times to add multiple lines to the
    buffer.  Then use ctrl-y ("yank") as before.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Opening and Saving Files</b>
    ctrl-x ctrl-s saves the current buffer.  ctrl-x
    ctrl-w does "save as".  ctrl-x ctrl-f lets you open a new buffer
    (but wants you to give it a name and directory at the
    same time) or an existing file.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Emacs Buffers vs. Files</b>
    Emacs distinguishes between "files" and "buffers".
    A file is something that exists in a directory
    somewhere.  The thing that you are dealing with in emacs
    is a "buffer" &mdash; a copy of the file in emacs's
    memory.  So when you type, you are changing the buffer,
    and only by saving the buffer to the file does the file
    itself change.
    You can have multiple buffers open in emacs at the same time.
    There's a "Buffers" menu you can use to switch between
    them, and you can split the window to show multiple
    buffers: ctrl-x 1 gives you a single buffer in the
    window, ctrl-x 2 splits the window horizontally to show
    two buffers, and ctrl-x 3 splits
    the window vertically to show
    two buffers
