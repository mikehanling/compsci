/***************************************************
Class Year From E-Mail Address

Write a program that reads in a midshipman's e-mail
address and prints out his class year. For example,
if you read in m031220@usna.edu you would print out
"Class of 2003".  You may assume that the class year
is 2000 or later.

  int alpha = readnum(stdin); // read number, we ignore the rest

  // compute class number
