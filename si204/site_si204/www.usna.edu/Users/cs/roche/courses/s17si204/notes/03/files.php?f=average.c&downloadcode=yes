/***************************************************
Average of numbers

Write a program that reads in positive integers from
the user, each separated by a space, and the whole
terminated by a negative number (e.g. 3 22 10 -2),
and returns the average of the numbers entered (not
including the terminated negative number!).  Note
that the average might not be an integer!
