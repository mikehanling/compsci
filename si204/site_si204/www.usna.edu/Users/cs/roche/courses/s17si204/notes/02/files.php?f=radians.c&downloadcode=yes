/***************************************************
Converting radians to degrees, minutes, seconds

Write a program that reads in an angle measure in
radians, and prints out the same angle measure in
degrees, minutes and seconds.  Remember, if d,m,s
is the degree/minutes/seconds measure, all must be
integers, m and s must be in [0,59], and the angle
in degrees must equal

        d + m/60 + s/3600

to within less than 1 second of a degree of error.

To convert from a radians angle measure to degrees,

        degrees = radians * 180/Pi

where Pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323846.

  // compute angle in degrees (with fractions)

  // compute whole minute number + leftover
  int m;

  double r2;
  r2 = r1 - m/60.0; // leftover in degrees

  // compute whole second number + leftover
