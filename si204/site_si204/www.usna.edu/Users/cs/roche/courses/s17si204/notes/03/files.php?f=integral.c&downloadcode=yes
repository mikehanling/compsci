/***************************************************
Integration of f(x) by simple end-point approximation

Write a program that will approximate the integral of

   f(x) = 2/sqrt(1-x^2)

The bounds of integration should be supplied by the
user, as well as the number of rectangles used in the
approximation.

Note:  The integral f(x) from 0 to 1 has a value
you should recognize!

Note:  You could change the function by changing a
single line in the code, in case you want to
approximate a different integral.
