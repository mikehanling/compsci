/*****************************************************************
 Volleyball version 2

 This is the current "rally rules" scoring of volleyball that is
 used in the Olympics.

 A game is a series of rallies. Each rally has a winning team,
 and the winning team scores one point. The first team to 25
 points who ALSO has 2 points more than their opponent, wins the
 game.

 In other words, in order to win, you have to have at least 25
 points and you have to have at least 2 points more than the other
 team.
