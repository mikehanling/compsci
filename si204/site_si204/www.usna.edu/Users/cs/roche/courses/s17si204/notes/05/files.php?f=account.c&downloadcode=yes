/*************************************************
FINANCIAL SIMULATION

You have a bank account whose annual interest
rate depends on the amount of money you have
in your account at the beginning of each year.
Your annual rate starts at 3%, and grows by an
additional half a percent for each thousand
dollars in your account up to, but not exceeding
8%. Interest in this account is compounded monthly
at the annual rate.  Each year you also make a
transaction (before the bank figures out what
your rate is).  Write a program that simulates
these financial interactions for 5 years.  At
the beginning of each year it should ask the
user whether he wants to make a deposit or
withdrawl and for how much.  At the end, it
should print out the balance at the end of the
5th year.
