<div class="sect"><u>Course Website</u>: The course website can be found at
<a href="https://www.usna.edu/cs/roche/courses/s17si204/">www.usna.edu/cs/roche/courses/s17si204/</a>.
Students are responsible for all material and assignments posted on the webpage, whether
or not they are mentioned explicitly mentioned in class.
</div>

<div class="sect"><u>Textbook(s)</u>: (none required)
</div>

<div class="sect"><u>MGSP</u>:  This course will be supported by the Midshipmen Group Study Program (MGSP).
 MGSP leaders are student volunteers who may be able to provide extra assistance
 during scheduled MGSP sessions, generally held in the evenings each week.
 <br/>
 The MGSP leaders for SI 204 this semester are:
 <ul>
 <li>2/C Andrew Sumida, m186312@usna.edu, 22nd Co.</li>
 <li>3/C Yair Abramoff, m190036@usna.edu, 17th Co.</li>
 </ul>

<div class="sect"><u>Extra Instruction</u>:  Extra instruction (EI) is strongly encouraged and should be scheduled by email 
 with the instructor. EI is not a substitute lecture; students should come 
 prepared with specific questions or problems.<br/>
 Except in special circumstances, students should seek EI only with their assigned
 instructor.

</div>
<div class="sect"><u>Collaboration</u>:  The guidance in the Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen and the Computer Science Department Honor Policy must be followed at all times. See 
<a href="https://www.usna.edu/CS/resources/honor.php">www.usna.edu/CS/resources/honor.php</a>. Specific instructions for this course:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Homework</b>: 
Students may collaborate with others in the same class, and may use any <em>static</em> online source. Receiving help from other students (other than MGSP leaders),
or posting questions in online help forums, is not permitted.
Any help received from any source must be clearly documented and turned in. All actual work (coding, pen-to-paper, etc.) must be done individually;
direct copying is never acceptable for credit. Students are expected to understand completely anything turned in for credit.
</li>
<li>
<b>Labs</b>: 
Students may receive help from others in the same class, and may use any <em>static</em> online source. Receiving help from other students (other than MGSP leaders),
or posting questions in online help forums, is not permitted.
Any help received from any source must be clearly documented and turned in. All actual work (coding, pen-to-paper, etc.) must be done individually;
direct copying is never acceptable for credit. Students are required to understand completely anything turned in for credit.
</li>
<li>
<b>Projects</b>:
No collaboration or (unless found on the course website) online assistance is permitted. Students may <em>verbally discuss</em> the project with other students
in the same class, for the sole purpose of understanding the instructions; these discussions may never touch on how to actually complete the project.
Any student may request to make use of some other online resource, but may only do so if the specific website is approved by the instructor.
<li>
<b>Exams</b>:
No collaboration or resources of any kind allowed, unless explicitly stated.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
All collaboration and outside sources should always be cited. The same
rules apply for giving and receiving assistance. If you are unsure
whether a certain kind of assistance or collaboration is permitted, you
should assume it is not, work individually, and seek clarification from
your instructor.<br/>

</div>
<div class="sect"><u>Classroom Conduct</u>:  The section leader will record attendance and bring the class to attention at the beginning and end of each class. If the instructor is late more than 5 minutes, the section leader will keep the class in place and report to the Computer Science department office. If the instructor is absent, the section leader will direct the class. Drinks are permitted, but they must be in reclosable containers. Food, alcohol, smoking, smokeless tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes are all prohibited. Cell phones must be silent during class. 
</div>
<div class="sect"><u>Late Policy</u>: Penalties for late submission of graded work may vary among courses or from semester to semester, but they will be the same for all sections of a given course. For <i>this</i> course:
</div>
<ul>
<li>For projects only, each student will be allowed a total of two "grace days" to use on any of the three projects assigned throughout the semester. Each grace day counts as a single 24 hour extension on the given deadline. Students using a grace day must notify their instructor at least 12 hours prior to the deadline.
<li>
Other than the grace days on projects, no late work will be accepted, except under extraordinary circumstances as approved by the instructor. Students on movement orders or otherwise not present when work is due
are expected to ensure their work is nonetheless handed in before the deadline.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="sect"><u>Grading</u>: Grades will be calculated as follows, with one exception: <b>All assigned work must be completed
to a satisfactory level of effort in order to pass the class</b>. That is, any assigned homework,
lab, or project must be turned in - <em>even if late and for zero credit</em> - in order to earn
a passing grade in the course. The definition of "satisfactory level of effort" is at the discretion
of the instructor, but generally means a C- level.
