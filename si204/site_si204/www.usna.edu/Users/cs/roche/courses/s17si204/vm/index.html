<p>
You will do much of your work for this class in a Linux virtual machine installed
on your laptop.
It's important that you get this working and become comfortable with the tools there.
</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Download the livecd ISO</b>.
  The LiveCD image we will use is the same as IC210 from last semester, as
  prepared by LCDR Kenney.
  <a href="http://yog.cs.usna.edu/~kenney/sw/IC210-LiveCD.iso">Here is a link to the ISO file</a>.
  Download that file (<code>IC210-LiveCD.iso</code>) and save it somewhere on your Windows
  laptop.<br>
  Here is the hash of that ISO file, in case you want to check the download integrity
  (no problem if you ignore this step):
  <pre><code class="language-text prompt">roche@ubuntu$ </code><code class="language-bash">sha256sum IC210-LiveCD.iso </code>
<code class="language-text output">0541ace4ec524db85e1cd6a9e584d70d8d214a4545cf2db0e8d82627bd8cd4f7  IC210-LiveCD.iso</code></pre>  <br>
  It's a big file, so the download might take a little while. In the meantime, you can...
</li>
<li><b>Download and install VMWare player</b>.
  This is the software that will run on your laptop to "host" the Linux virtual machine.
  VMWare Player is freely available for educational use from
  <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/playerpro-evaluation.html">this website</a>.
  <br>
  Download the version for your laptop (most likely 64-bit Windows), and then follow through
  with the install like any other Windows software.
  (If you're asked to enter a license key, leave it blank.)
  <br>
  LCDR Kenney has some <a href="http://yog.cs.usna.edu/~kenney/sw/vmplayer_install2.htm">instructions
  from an earlier version</a> that might be helpful if you get stuck here.
</li>
<li><b>Create your VM inside VMWare player</b>.
  Once the ISO is downloaded and VMWare player is installed, follow
  <a href="http://yog.cs.usna.edu/~kenney/sw/vmplayer_guide/guide.html">these instructions
  from LCDR Kenney's page</a> on how to do that.

  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>:
  <ul>
  <li>
    You must use the <em>same username</em> as your regular USNA username
    when installing Linix inside the VM, like <code>m190000</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can use <em>any password</em> you like. It doesn't have to match your
    USNA password, and in fact it's totally independent from it.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
</li>
<li><b>Run the SI204 setup script inside your VM</b>
  <p>Once Linux has been installed inside your VM, log in and open a terminal
  window from the Applications menu or by typing Ctrl-Alt-T.
  Then enter the following command and hit enter:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-text output">cmd=$(curl -sf yog/~roche/204/vm/bs) && eval $cmd</code></pre>  <p>This should run you through a bunch of things, updating files and
  installing software. Read what it says and enter
  your password when required to install software. If something goes wrong,
  you can run the same command and it will try again. Don't be afraid to
  ask for help if something goes wrong and you can't get it to work.
  </p>
  <p><b>NOTE</b>: Part of the process that may be a little confusing is when you create an RSA
  public/private key pair. This will make your connections to the CS unix server
  much easier <em>and</em> more secure. The main thing to know is that,
  <em>your private key passphrase can be whatever you want</em> - in fact,
  you can even leave it blank!</p>
</li>
