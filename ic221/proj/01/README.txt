I originally wrote the bulk of the code fixed the small bugs to get it
to compile. 

I then made sure than error checking worked well, with the right
message.

Then I had to take a good bit of time bebugging the output numbers.  The
characters were easy, the lines I got after like two tries.  Word count
took me getting away from the assignment and asking Capt Rye for weird
cases that I was not thinking of.  I finally figured it out.
