I started with the mini-sh that we had a few labs ago.  From there I
analyzed babypipe and sleep-unroll to see where each section of code had
to go -- whether it was setup, for each command, in the child, in the
parent, reset commands, etc.  Then I made sure that all the variable
names worked and that all loop conditions would still be relevant in
this setup.  After that, I fixed small bugs in output until I got to the
92% level.
