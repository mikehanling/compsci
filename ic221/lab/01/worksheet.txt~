Part 1: The Man Pages  (___/25)


   (5/3/0)
   1. For the =ls= command, what option prints information out in long
      form, like =-l=, but does not print any file ownership
      information? In the worksheet, provide a copy of the output
      using =ls= with this option run from the *top level* of the lab
      directory.

   
   2. Change into the =part1= directory and type =ls=. You will see a
      list of files =a b c d e f g=. 
   
      (4/2/0)   
      a. Note that =ls= lists the files in alphabetic order. What =ls=
         option will list the files in /reverse/ alphabetic order? Provide
         a copy of your output of your =ls= with the addition of =-l=
         in your worksheet.
 

      (3/1/0)   
      b. What =ls= options will sort the files by /size/ from largest
         to smallest? Provide a copy of your output of your =ls= with
         the addition of =-l= in your worksheet.

      (3/1/0)   
      c. What =ls= option will sort the files in /reverse size/ order
         from smallest to largest. Provide a copy of your output of
         your =ls= with the addition of =-l= in your worksheet.

   (5/3/0)
   3. Remove the =g= file using the =rm= command. Notice that the
      shell asked you to confirm removing the item.  Look at the
      manual for =rm=, what option must have been invoked when you
      issued that command? What option can you use to avoid having to
      confirm the removal of an item?

   (5/3/1/0)
   4. Read the manual page for the =touch= command. One
      of the uses for =touch= is to update the last modified timestamp
      of a file (you can view that last modified using =ls -l=). Use
      the =touch= command to create a file =y2k= whose last
      modification time was Dec. 31 1999 at 23:59.59. Include the
      command you used on your worksheet and a copy of your =ls -l=
      output of the =y2k= file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: cat, less, and more (__/25)

   (5/3/0)
   1. Use =cat= to place a "Beat Army!" at the start of Hemmingway's a
      very short story and "Go Navy!" at the end. Include the command
      you used on your worksheet.

  (5/3/0)
   2. Why is =less= =more=?

   3. Use =less= to open =dickens.txt=:

      (5/3/0)
      a. Search for the first instance of "Fagin", what is the line of
         that text?

      (5/3/0)
      b. Find the *second to last* instance of "Fagin". Describe how
         you did that and the sentence it appears in.
   
      (5/3/0)
      c. Go to line 1845, what is the name of that chapter? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 3: Viewing Files Conditionally (__/20)

   (5/3/0)
   1. Read the man pages for =head= and =less=, produce a command line
      to print the first kilobyte of the database file. Note, a
      kilobyte is 2^10 or 1024 bytes. Include the command line in your worksheet.

   (5/3/0)
   2. Use =less= or =grep= to find the line number of
      "Mastella". Produce a =sed= command to just print the line with
      "Mastella" and the following 5 lines. Include the command line
      in your worksheet.

   (5/3/0)
   3. How many people's first name is "Pamella"? Use =grep= to find
      that out. 

   (5/3/0)
   4. Read the =man= page for grep. Print out the all the lines from
      people who *do not* have an address in NJ. Include the command
      line in your worksheet.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 4: Pipelines and Counting (__/30)

   (10/8/5/0)
   1. Create a pipeline to count the number of unique states
      represented in the database file. Include the pipeline in your
      worksheet.

   (10/8/5/0)
   2. How many first names in the file repeat? How many last names?
      Include the pipelines used to determine this.

   (10/8/5/0)
   
   3. Write a pipeline to first print to the terminal all the unique
      telephone area codes? This includes both sets of phone
      numbers. However, if you're unable to do that for both sets,
      provide a pipeline for at least one set. Once complete,  add
      to your pipeline how to sort those numerical?
      (Hint: read the man page for =sort=).
