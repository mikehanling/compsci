  Replace the X's above with your name and alpha, and also list any collaborator
  or other resources you used. Please also indicate the number of hours
  (including hours in the lab period) you spent on this assignment.

  After completing the assignment, please answer these questions to provide
  feedback.

  * What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned again that the built in kernel commands that I use all the
time are not run my magic elves in my computer.  It is somewhat trivial
to emulate them.

  * What part of the assignment was easier then you expected?
The mycp ended up being easier than I thought to actually do the copying
part

  * What part of the assignment was harder then you expected?
Dealing with the different time structs in mytouch ended up being harder
than I anticipated.

  * What would you suggest for improving this assignment?
Nothing.

  * Any additional information you'd like to share regarding this assignment?
If all of the test files could be in a directory for use to use as well
that would be really helpful.  I tried on some functions on test files
of my own and it worked, so I would be curious to see the difference on
the actual test files used in the test script.

  Below, fill out this worksheet with the appropriate answers/comments
  to the following questions/prompts. If there are no direct
  questions, please provide some basic comments about each part of the
  assignment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task 1: Simple Makefile
This is very useful and not hard to do. (Done together as a class.)

Task 2: Multipart Makefile
A little trickier but definitely understood now.

Task 3: mycp
After opening the input file for reading and the output file for
writing, copies the file in BUFFSIZE chunks until EOF is reached. Closes
files.

Task 4: myls
Each file's pertinent information is relayed to the terminal.

Task 5: mytouch
Access and modication time are updated to the current time held by the
computer.  The old and new mod times are relayed to the terminal.
