  Replace the X's above with your name and alpha, and also list any collaborator
  or other resources you used. Please also indicate the number of hours
  (including hours in the lab period) you spent on this assignment.

  After completing the assignment, please answer these questions to provide
  feedback.

  * What did you learn from this assignment?
      I learned that scripting is not hard to do, and very useful.  I
      also learned that you can check email from the command line.

  * What part of the assignment was easier then you expected?
      The first three or four tasks were easy, as they seemed to just be
      answers from the previous lab just in a file.

  * What part of the assignment was harder then you expected?
      Remembering the "then" for all the "if"s.

  * What would you suggest for improving this assignment?
      Maybe have the end result one script that is built from all the
      others to see the power of scripting.  Having the tasks was good
      for checking along the way, so just keep copying the file to a new
      directory.

  * Any additional information you'd like to share regarding this
    assignment?

  Below, fill out this worksheet with the appropriate answers/comments to the
  following questions/prompts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each of the tasks, describe your script logic, any issue you had,
and any other information you'd like to share with the instructor.

Task 1: cut the entire file for the 5th field (name) and report it back.


Task 2: grep the line that includes the given username.  Report the name
that is in field 5 of that line.


Task 3: Ensure there is only one argument from the command line.  So
long as the file exists, report the size of the file.


Task 4: Loop over all arguments.  So long as the file exists, set a
variable to the size of the file, and report the filename and size back.


Task 5: Check for all errors first.  Set a variable equal to the size of
the file.  Compare to the given size and report accordingly.


Task 6: It first checks that there are at least two arguments (size and
one or more files).  The for loop then loops on all of the FILE
arguments, calling isbiggerthan.sh which checks for all the errors and
exits on a certain exit code.  The exit code is examined to either throw
an error, print the filename saying is it greater than or equal to, or
continuing otherwise.


Extra: (describe any cool things you did to modify your terminal)
