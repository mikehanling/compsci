Welcome to SI204!

If you're reading this file, then congrats! You've installed your VM
and run the SI204 script to set it up correctly.

The next step is to download the submit script (customized for you!)
that you'll use to submit all your assignments in this class. Get it by
going to:
and signing in with your USNA username and password. Copy the downloaded
file to your bin/ directory.

Other things to remember and keep in mind:
* Always run "csmount" to mount your csunix/ directory before starting
  work
* Save your files under the csunix/ directory to keep them backed up
  and accessible in the labs.
* Work on each assignment in a separate folder with that assignment's
  name. For example, for the first lab you probably want to do your work
  (meaning, save your code) in a folder called "lab01".

This is a lot of new stuff to get used to! Don't feel bad to ask
questions in MGSP or contact your instructor for EI.
