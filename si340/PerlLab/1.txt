This semester SI433 is running for
the last time take it while you can.
EM300 is running as always, but don't
try taking it out of sequence. We
got two OSI2 people, one teaching
SI204 (or is it IC210?), the other
teaching IT310 as well as SI283. I
don't think there is a SI496A running
this Spring. The SI 2008 course 
offerings look like they're nailed
down, though.
