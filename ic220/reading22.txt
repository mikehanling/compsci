Key Points:
  Truth Table: From logic, a representation of a logical operation by
  listing all the values of the inputs and then in each case showing
  what the resulting outputs should be

  Don't-care term: an element of a logical function in which the
  output does not depend on the values of all the inputs.

  Opcode: the field that denotes the operation and format of an
  instruction

  Floating point addition is not associative

  Execution strategies for int operations will not always work with
  other types

  addiu does not sign-extend
