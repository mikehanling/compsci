Key Points:
  Virtual Memory : A technique that uses main memory as a "cache" for
  secondary storage

  Physical address : an address in main memory

  Protection : A set of mechanisms for ensuring that multiple processes
  sharing the processor, memory, or I/O devices cannot interfere,
  intentionally or unintentionally, with one another by reading or
  writing each other's data. These mechanism,s also isolate the
  operating system from a user process

  Page fault : an event that occurs when an accessed page is not present
  in main memory

  Virtual address : an address that corresponds to a location in virtual
  space and is translated by address mapping to a physical address when
  a memory is accessed.

  Address translation : also called address mapping, the process by
  which a virtual address is mapped to an address used to access memory

  Segmentation : a variable-size address mapping scheme in which an
  address consists of two parts: a segment number, which is mapped to a
  physical address, and a segment offset

  Page table : the table containing the virtual to physical address
  translation in a virtual memory system. The table, which is stored in
  memory, is typically, indexed by the virtual page number; each entry
  in the table contains the physical page number for that virtual page
  id the page is currently in memory

  Swap space : the space on the disk reserved for the full virtual
  memory space of a process

  Reference bit : or use but, a field that is set whenever a page is
  accessed and that is used to implement LRU or other replacement
  schemes

  Translation-lookaside buffer (TLB) : a cache that keeps track of
  recently used address mappings to try to avoid an access to the
  page table.

  Virtually addressed cache : a cache that is accessed with a virtual
  address rather than a physical address

  Aliasing : a situation in which two addresses access the same object;
  it can occur in virtual memory when there are two virtual addresses
  for the same physical page

  System call : a special instruction that transfer control from user
  mode to a dedicated location in supervisor code space, invoking the
  exception mechanism in the process

  Prefetching : a technique in which data blocks needed in the future
  and brought into the cache early by the use of special instructions
  that specify the address of the block
