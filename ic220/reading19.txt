R12: 2.4, 3.1 - 3.3


Key Points:
  Binary digit == binary bit == 0 || 1
  LSB - right most, corresponding to 1 or 0
  MSB - left most, corresponding to 2^n or 0
  Unsigned TYPE has more positive range that signed TYPE
    No negative numbers, all positive
  MSB is sign bit in signed numbers
  Subtraction: addition's tricky pal
  MIPS instructions: addu, subu, addiu
  Exception: an unscheduled event that disrupts program execution;
              used to detect overflow
  Interrupt: An exception that comes from outside of the processor.
              (Some architectures use the term interrupt for all
              exceptions.)
  Multiplication is vexation. Division is as bad; The rule of three doth
              puzzle me, and practice drives me mad.
  Mult: do the adds in parallel

What Confuses Me:
  None
