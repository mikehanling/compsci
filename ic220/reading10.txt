Key Points:
  Performance
    response time == execution time : time to complete a task
    throughput == bandwidth : # tasks completed / unit time
    CPU time : actual time the CPU spends computing for a task
    user CPU time : CPU time spent in a program itself
    system CPU time : CPU time spent in the operating system performing
                          tasks on behalf of the program
    clock cycle : constant rate at which processor clock goes through
                           one period
    clock period : the length of each clock cycle
    CPI : clock cycles per instruction (average)
  Benchmarking
    program of standard workload to measure computers against each other
  Fallacies and Pitfalls
    Amdahl's Law : the performance enhancement possible with a given
                      improvement is limited by the amount that the
                      improved feature is used. it is a quantitative
                      version of the law of diminishing returns
    MIPS : million instructions per second
            (instruction count / (execution time * 10^6))
    


What Confuses Me:
