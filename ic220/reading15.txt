Key Points:
  Edge-trigered clocking: scheme in which all state changes occur on a
                          clock edge
  Clocking methodology: the approach used to determine when data is
                        valid and stable relative to the clock
  State Element: a memory element
  Synchronous system: memory system that employs clock and where data
                      signals are read only when the clock indicates that the
                      signal values are stable
  Register file: a state element that consists of a set of registers
                  that can be read and written by supplying a register number to
                  be accessed
  Flip-flop: memory element for which the output is equal to the value
            of the stored state inside the element and doe which the internal
            state is changed only on a clock edge
  Latch: memory element in which the output is equal to the value of the
         stored state inside the element and the state is changed whenever the
         appropriate inputs change and the clock is asserted
  D flip-flop: a flip-flop with one data input signal in the internal
              memory when the clock edge occurs.
  Setup time: the minimum time that the input to a memory device must be
              value before the clock edge
  Hold time: the minimum time during which the input must be valid after
              the clock edge
  Static Memory Access Memory (SRAM): memory where data is stored
                                      statically (as in flip-flops) rather than
                                      dynamically (as in DRAM).
                                      SRAMs are faster than DRAMs, but less dense
                                      and more expensive per bit
  Error detection code: code that enable the detection of an error in
                        data, but not the precise location and, hence, correction
                        of the error
  Finite-state machine: sequential logic function consisting of a set of
                        inputs and out puts, a next-state function that maps the
                        current state and inputs to a new state, and an output 
                        function that maps the
                        current state and possibly the inputs to a sett of 
                        asserted outputs
  Next-state function: a combinational function that, given the inputs
                      and the current state, determines the next state
                      of a finite-state machine
  Field programmable devices (FPD): integrated circuit containing the
                                    combinational logic, and possibly memory 
                                    devices, that are configurable by the end user
  Programmable logic device (PLD): integrated circuit containing
                                  combinational logic whose function is 
                                  configured by the end user
  Field programmable gate array (FPGA): configurable integrated circuit
                                        containing both combinational logic 
                                        blocks and flip-flops
  Simple programmable logic device (SPLD): programmable logic device,
                                          usually containing either a single PAL 
                                          or PLA
  Programmable array logic (PAL): contains a programmable and-plane
                                  followed by a fixed or-plane
  Antifuse: structure in an integrated circuit that when programmed
            makes a permanent connection between two wires
  Look up tables (LUTs): in an FPD, the name given to the cells because
                          they consist of a small amount of logic and RAM
