R20: 3.5

Key Points:
  Floating point allows the decimal point position to not be fixed
  Fraction is called a mantissa
  (-1)^sight X mantissa X 2^exponent
  Double precision: float stored as TWO 32-bit (4-byte) words
  Single precision: float stored as ONE 32-bit (4-byte) word
  After computation, always normalize mantissa and update exp
  add.s / add.d -> add for (s) single or (d)double precision
  same for sub. mul. div.
  c.x.s / c.x.d for compare where x is eq/neq/lt/le/gt/ge
  bclt or bclf for branch if true and branch if false
  Guard: the first of two buts kept of the right during intermediate
    calculations of floating-point numbers; used to improve rounding
    accuracy
