R25: 4.1 - 4.5


Key Points:
  Send the program counter to the memory that contains the code and
  fetch the instruction from that memory.

  Read one or two registers, using the fields of the instruction to
  select the registers to read. For lw we need to read only one
  register, but most require two.

  Combinational element: an operational element, such as an AND gate or
  an ALU.

  State element: a memory element, such as a register or a memory.

  Clocking methodology: the approach used to determine when data is
  valid and stable relative to the clock.

  Edge-triggered clocking: a clocking scheme in which all state changes
  occur on a clock edge.

  Control signal: a signal used for multiplexor selection or for
  directing the operation of a functional unit; contrasts with a data
  signal, which contains information that is operated on by a functional
  unit.

  asserted: the signal is logically high or true
  deasserted: the signal is logically low or false

  datapath element: a unit used to operate on or hold data within a
  processor.  In the MIPS  implementation, the datapath elemetnts include
  the instruction and data memories, the register file, the ALU, and
  adders.

  program counter: the register containing the address of the
  instruction in the program being executed.  

  register file: a state element that consists of a set of registers
  that can be read and written by supplying a register number to be
  accessed.

  single-cycle implementation: implementation in which an instruction is
  executed in one clock cycle. While easy to understand, it is too slow
  to be practical.
