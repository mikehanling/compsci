Key Points:
    Basic building blocks of logic are GATES
    Gates operate on high or low voltage
    Asserted signal: true or 1
    Deasserted signal: false or 0
    Combinational logic does not contain memory
    Sequential logic does
    Boolean algebra is used to represent the gates
    Decoder: a logic block that has an n-bit input and 2n outputs,
                where only one output is asserted for each input
                combination
    Multiplexor: a selector; selects one of the inputs as the output
    Selector / Control Value: the signal used to select one of the input
                                values of a multiplexor
    Sum of Products: OR of ANDs
    ROM: read-only memory
    Bus: collection of data lines that is treated together as a single
          logical signal
    Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): device that performs all the math and
                                  logic
    MIPS's ALU is in Verilog
