Key Points:
  Conditional Branches
    beq reg1, reg2, L1
      go to instr L1 if value in reg1 == value in reg2
    bne reg1, reg2, L1
      same as above but !=
  Unconditional Branches:
    called jumps (j)
  Label pieces of if/then block with Else: and Exit:
  Label loop with Loop:
  Test for less than:
    slt/i destreg, reg1, reg2  # tests for reg1 < reg2
    sets destreg equal to 1 if true, otherwise 0
    For unsigned, use sltu and sltiu
  Jump Address Table / Jump Table:
    jr
    unconditional jump to make case or switch happen



What Confused Me:
  jr - not sure how to use it
